# Smile detector 

This directory contains scripts related to the all study on smile detector.    
The purpose of the project is to train Deep Learning model that allows us to detect smile on the user face. The output of this algorithm will be then used to train  Reinforcement Learning agent.   


## The study phases 

### Machine Learning approach. 
In this step, the study is based on classical machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVN and kNN. I take as an input raw pixels values. The result serves as a baseline for the further study. 

### Shallow Convolutional Neural Network

Second step is to train Shallow Convolutional Neural Network. It contains 2 convolutional layers and it is trained from scratch. 

### Transfer Learning

In this, final step the I will use pre-trained model with replaced last, classification layer. 
#Will be updated
