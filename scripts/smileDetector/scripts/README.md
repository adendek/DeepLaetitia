# Smile detector 

This directory contains scripts that document all study on smile detector.  
The purpose of the project is to train Deep Learning model that allows us to detect smile on the user face. The output of this algorithm will be then proceeded by the Reinforcement Learning agent.  

### Installation
Before you start, make sure you unziped dataset. To do this you need to execute following commands:  

``` bash
cd ../dataset/ 
tar -xf dataset.tgz
ls -all 
```
The last command should returns: 
 
```
Test			Training 		dataset.tgz
```

## The study phases 

### Machine Learning approach. 
In this step, the study is based on classical machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest. The result will serve as a baseline for the further study. 

### Second Phase
Will be updated
